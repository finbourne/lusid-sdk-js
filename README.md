# LUSID<sup>Â®</sup> JavaScript SDK

A generated version of the SDK is included in the `sdk` folder based on the OpenAPI specification named `lusid.json` in the root folder.  The most up to date version of the OpenAPI specification can be downloaded from https://api.lusid.com/swagger/v0/swagger.json

The SDK can also be installed using `npm`:

```
$ npm install @finbourne/lusid
```

# Generating the SDK
If you would prefer to generate the Javsscript SDK locally from the FINBOURNE OpenAPI specification, follow these steps:

- download the latest swagger.json file from https://api.lusid.com/swagger/index.html
- save it in this directory as lusid.json
- run `$ docker-compose up && docker-compose rm -f`
